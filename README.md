# M2Mqtt

![](images/m2mqtt6.png)

M2Mqtt is a MQTT-3.1.1 client available for all .NET Core platforms for Internet of Things and M2M communication.

MQTT, short for Message Queue Telemetry Transport, is a light weight messaging protocol that enables embedded devices with limited resources to perform asynchronous communication on a constrained network.

MQTT protocol is based on publish/subscribe pattern so that a client can subscribe to one or more topics and receive messages that other clients publish on these topics.

For all information about MQTT protocol, please visit official web site  http://mqtt.org/.
